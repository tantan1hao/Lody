**Dispatch architecture: context/message-flow.md**
— user turns arrive by being written into the session doc (meta pointers), not via a
message bus. The WS/DO path is DEPRECATED.

Session CLI/MCP orchestration contract:
specs/session-orchestration.md. Target-machine
authorization is checked by the injected access capability with the source CLI token,
which derives the requester identity at the trusted boundary. Do not send a caller-supplied requester
through workspace Machine RPC: that transport does not authenticate member identity.
Live status is a target-daemon Machine RPC read, and durable session metadata is not a
live-presence substitute.
Session orchestration MCP intentionally runs with the daemon owner's CLI credential,
including for teammate-started Sessions on a shared machine. Do not add requester
delegation proofs or a shared-machine gate without a new product and security decision.

- `session-dispatch-watcher.ts` — the current dispatch entry: watches
  `repo.watch('doc-metadata')` + per-session mirror subscribe; dispatches when
  `latestUserMsgId` ≠ `lastHandledUserMsgId`. Also accepts `session/dispatch-turn`
  Machine RPC pushes via `offerRpcTurn` (ack-then-execute: stash the payload as a
  third turn source — history → queue → stash — and wake the per-session check
  chain; the RPC ack means delivered, not authorized/executed). Absent session
  meta during watch reconciliation is "unknown", not foreign: a freshly created
  session's RPC turn can reach this machine before its meta syncs, so the
  TTL-bounded RPC stash must survive until meta lands and only a definitive
  verdict — deleted doc, another machine's session, or an archived one — drops
  it. Fast-path turns
  that finish before their history entry syncs are reconciled by
  `maybeRepairAlreadyHandledTurn` (late `pending` entry gets flipped to its
  recorded terminal status, never re-dispatched). Extensive header comment is the
  authoritative doc for edge cases (stale pointers, history/meta sync races).
  Turn-resolution waits must subscribe to RPC offers before awaiting Doc Room
  join/sync; the offer wakes the existing serialized resolver and must never
  dispatch directly from the RPC handler. History synchronization continues as
  the durable fallback and output-ordering gate, not as a fast-path prerequisite.
  Missing-history delivery recovery must never advance `lastHandledUserMsgId`;
  preserve the producer/executor pointers, set `lastMissingHistoryUserMsgId` as a
  negative acknowledgement for that exact turn, and surface a `chat_failed` notice
  instead. The marker is a PERMANENT one-shot negative ack for the exact turn id:
  watch activation and turn selection (history AND the RPC stash) suppress pointers
  only when their id matches that marker; a different producer id wakes the session
  without any read-await-clear race. A late-arriving history entry is NEVER
  re-dispatched — no path revives the old turn. The renderer derives a visible
  "not delivered" label for that exact entry from the marker plus its non-terminal
  status (no CLI repair write, no schema change), and recovery is a fresh send:
  the row's "not delivered" label opens a confirmation dialog that re-sends the
  SAME content as a brand-new message (new turn id) through the ordinary
  producer path, whose ordinary dispatch write clears the marker as a side
  effect; the resend also supersedes the abandoned entry to `canceled` so the
  stale pending copy can never dispatch once the marker is gone. The watcher
  must not publish or clear
  session active presence; `../lib/loro/session-active-presence.ts` is the only owner
  for start/phase/heartbeat/clear. Owned-session startup/meta bootstrap scans may contain
  thousands of rooms. Session metadata is the activation index: an idle row with no
  pending pointer, queue watermark, cancel, active status, RPC offer, or access retry
  stays metadata-only even when it has no `lastHandledUserMsgId`; never inspect every
  historical Session document to infer work from history. Reconcile activated rooms
  with one global four-room concurrency bound shared by bootstrap and live metadata,
  and keep initial history/cancel checks inside that bound rather than spawning
  unbounded promise chains. Bootstrap may occupy at most three slots so a live
  activation cannot sit behind four five-minute history probes. Live metadata events
  must be coalesced by session before the bounded drain runs. Stop/restart generation
  fences cover reconciliation plus the checks it enqueues; old probes may finish I/O
  but must never subscribe, cancel, or dispatch in a new watcher lifecycle. That scan is
  idempotent and costs
  seconds of main-thread work, so `enqueueBootstrap` folds concurrent requests into a
  single queued drain (`pendingBootstrapReasons` + `bootstrapChain`) — none are dropped.
  `recheckPendingAccess` only wakes watched or access-retry sessions — never a catalog
  scan. Follow-up `meta-room-synced:*` reasons that arrive during a scan are discarded
  after it; later events still enqueue. Do not restore a per-trigger scan: `onMetaRoomSynced` fires on Streams recovery, so a
  misread transport edge turns into an O(rooms) scan every few seconds. Coalescing bounds
  the work per trigger, not the trigger rate — keeping that rate sane is the connection
  recovery boundary's job, and it now does: `onMetaRoomSynced` is rate-limited in
  `../lib/loro/connection-recovery.ts`, while the cheap "back online" edge moved to
  `onStreamsOnline`. Do not add a competing throttle here — that would move the cost
  model and hide the one that matters
  (context/code-collab-flow.md).
- `turn-history-gate.ts` — ordering barrier for RPC fast-path turns: the agent
  starts immediately, but turn-scoped history LIST writes (assistant entry, ACP
  flushes, finalization, failure notices) wait until the user turn entry has
  synced into the CLI-local doc (bounded, 20s), otherwise concurrent Loro list
  inserts can permanently order the reply before the user message. The gate
  itself creates the assistant entry when it opens; created in message-handler's
  `beginConversationTurn`, stored/disposed via `SessionTransientStore` turn state.
  Status/meta map writes are never gated (some sit on the prompt critical path).
- `session-dispatch-logic.ts` — pure decision functions for the watcher (testable).
- `session-execution-service.ts` — runs one turn end-to-end: ACP prompt, turn ids,
  lifecycle/error handling, GitHub/local project setup, and post-turn diffStats.
  Goal lifecycle is independent from prompt lifecycle: an `active` session goal does
  not suppress turn completion or completion notification once the current prompt is
  quiescent. Use live execution/presence for current-work signals; goal activity may
  still protect history rewrites or an in-memory runtime that can resume autonomously.
  It is the per-session execution mutex: never mint a second visible turn while a
  `TurnRuntimeState` is registered. User-dispatch turns derive assistant entry ids
  from `userTurnId` (`assistant:<userTurnId>`), so a retried/recovered dispatch reuses
  the same history entry.
  INVARIANT: a steer (guide) the agent never accepted must not stay parked in
  `pending_apply` — dispatch skips that status, so nothing else would ever run it.
  `requeueUndeliveredSteer` hands it back to ordinary dispatch, and the load-bearing
  write is the `latestUserMsgId` POINTER, not the entry status: `sessionNeedsActiveWatch`
  reads meta only, so a turn visible solely in history is dropped the moment the
  session goes idle (the watcher unsubscribes) and never reconsidered, restart
  included. That is also why `findNextDispatchableUserTurn` dispatches a
  `pending_apply` entry the pointer explicitly names — the flip to `pending` is a UI
  and durability nicety that a not-yet-synced entry never receives. Only
  pre-submission rejections plus the agent's own `AgentSteerNotDeliveredError` refusal
  qualify: after submission the provider may already have committed the steer, and
  re-sending would duplicate it. An entry that is already active, terminal, or past
  `lastHandledUserMsgId` is left alone so a late duplicate cannot resurrect a turn.
  `latestUserMsgId` has single-writer-role ownership: dispatch producers (Web/CLI
  sends, edit-and-resend, refused-steer requeue, and accepted steer ownership
  transfer) may publish it and clear a prior missing-history marker. Ordinary turn
  execution writes only `processingUserMsgId` and `lastHandledUserMsgId`; its start,
  success, failure, denial, and cancel paths must never read-await-rewrite
  `latestUserMsgId` or `lastMissingHistoryUserMsgId`. Otherwise a terminal write for
  turn A can overwrite the activation for turn B that arrived during an awaited
  history mutation, leaving B pending and permanently unwatched.
  Because teardown/cancel finalize (`message-handler.ts`
  `finalizeACPState`, no-turnId overload) stamps `finished=true`/`endedAt` on the
  in-progress entry, resume must **reopen** it: `writeAssistantEntryForTurn`'s
  existing-entry branch clears `finished`/`endedAt`/`permissionWaitMs` when re-adopting
  the entry for a live turn. Without that reset a machine-death-then-resume turn streams
  new output into a `finished=true` entry — the web renderer folds the still-streaming
  turn into a `Worked for …` summary and shared "active assistant entry" logic
  (`@lody/shared` `schema.ts` terminal predicate) treats it as done. Keep the reset
  scoped to this reopen branch (it only runs at genuine turn (re)start via
  `openAssistantEntry`); never write `finished=false` from the teardown paths. Renderer
  side: packages/components/src/components/ai-gui/AGENTS.md ("Worked for …" collapse gate).
  ACP error classification lives in `acp-error-classification.ts`; keep new
  JSON-RPC/transport string matching there instead of scattering it through the
  execution service. A `-32603 Internal error` whose details say the connection
  is disposed/stale is an `agent_disconnected` case, not a generic
  `acp_internal_error`. Continue-session prompt recovery may terminate and restore
  the ACP session once before retrying the same prompt, but only when no ACP output
  has buffered/flushed for that assistant turn; after visible output, never replay
  the user prompt automatically.
  DeepSeek Harness persistence compression mismatches are a distinct
  `acp_session_storage_incompatible` failure, not a generic internal error; keep
  matching narrow to the backend's artifact/compression diagnostic.
  INVARIANT: a prompt that RESOLVES is not proof the turn succeeded. Nothing reads
  `PromptResponse.stopReason`, and an adapter may swallow an upstream failure and
  resolve normally (observed: an over-context request answered with HTTP 400, kept
  only in the agent's own session file), so `handleTurnError` never sees it. The
  no-output guard is the backstop: `turnProducedVisibleOutput` is read right after
  the prompt returns — before `finalizeTurn` clears the turn's ACP update state —
  and a turn that emitted no ACP update at all takes `recordSilentTurnFailure`
  (`agent_no_output` notice + `markTurnFailed`) instead of `setDispatchHandled`,
  and skips the completion notification. It still runs the full finalization
  (diff stats, PR detection, auto-commit) and still ADVANCES the dispatch pointer:
  the prompt was delivered, so re-dispatching would spin the same silent failure.
  A missing `hasPromptOutputForTurn` dep fails open — never accuse a turn on a guess.
  Code Collab v1 turn markers and history fileDiff capture were removed. v2 may
  persist exact per-turn path/add/del caches derived from the CLI-local ACP evidence
  store after ACP finalization; diff content still comes only from the CLI store.
  The post-turn shared-state refresh remains best effort after a turn/cancel/error.
  Shortcut for PR/sidebar line-count parity: GitHub session `diffStats` are written by
  `turn-post-processing-service.updateSessionDiffStats()` from
  `../lib/git/git-diff-stats.ts`. It must use PR compare semantics
  (`merge-base(PR base, HEAD)` → `HEAD`) rather than dirty working-tree totals.
  Code Collab All Changes may write the compact owner-room `diffStats` summary for
  confirmed local sessions and GitHub sessions without an open PR
  (`session-diff-stats-target.ts`). GitHub sessions with an open PR keep the
  committed PR-compare writer above; unresolved project state and incomplete
  All Changes line stats must skip instead of overwriting a trustworthy total.
- `session-manager.ts` / `session.ts` — session/process lifecycle, workdirs and
  worktrees. `Session.createAgent` acquires the shared ACP start gate before
  spawn so a parent session cannot restore or start many Codex children at once.
  ACP terminal creation must pass the protocol's executable and argument array
  directly to `SessionSandbox.spawn`; never rebuild them into a shell command,
  because doing so changes argument semantics and consumes Windows path backslashes.
  Child tab sessions must reuse the parent workspace directory: local/GitHub
  parents reconstruct via workdir/worktree data, and chat-only parents fall back to the
  parent's default `~/.lody/chats/<parentSessionId>` path when the parent process is no
  longer in memory. Do not write per-session workspace paths into `MachineMeta`; the
  machine publishes `['dotlodyPath']` in its machine Flock doc and frontends derive
  `~/.lody/chats/<sessionId>` or `~/.lody/repos/<repoId>/worktrees/<sessionId>`.
  Worktree setup scripts are per worktree-directory lifetime: session runtime restore
  after idle GC must skip setup when the session's worktree directory already exists,
  but setup still runs when a missing worktree directory is materialized again.
  A fresh local/GitHub worktree always owns a newly allocated branch from its selected
  base ref; suffix collisions instead of attaching to an existing ref. Reattaching an
  existing branch is reserved for an explicit `restoreBranchName` from the same Session.
  INVARIANT: any `sandbox.spawn` whose OUTPUT is the result must pass
  `captureOutput: true` (`session-sandbox.ts`). spawn() does async post-spawn work
  (pid wait, resource profile, cgroup attach), and under a stalled event loop a short
  command exits and its stdio is destroyed — dropping buffered output — before the
  caller subscribes; `exec()` then resolves `''` and also ignores the exit code, so a
  failed command is indistinguishable from an empty one. This is why a session that
  had just opened a PR reported "detached HEAD" and never associated it. Long-lived
  ACP stdio deliberately does NOT capture (it streams and would grow unbounded).
  The capture buffer is capped (4 MiB, oldest chunks evicted) because consumers
  apply their own limits only after they subscribe.
  Shutdown is two-phase: `cleanUp({ keepWorkspaceDocumentOpen: true })` terminates all
  session/preparation producers but deliberately leaves the document manager and credentials
  alive so MessageHandler can flush final ACP/Code Collab evidence; the later plain `cleanUp()`
  closes shared resources. Never restore document teardown ahead of session termination.
- `session-preparation-service.ts` — process-local speculative ACP lease/state owner.
  Peek/claim are synchronous published-resource snapshots and must never delay cold
  fallback; peek never transfers ownership. A prepared resource may reuse its open
  target-machine Flock to synchronously resolve launch config, but dispatch and claim
  must rescan the current row and reject changed compatibility. Publish the resource
  before its `start()` hook: worktree/ACP side effects must never begin while the
  resource is invisible to synchronous claim. Preparation may create the final marked
  worktree and complete `newSession`, but must not create a session doc, run worktree
  setup, append history, or publish session events before adoption. Durable creation
  claims the marker only when repo/source/base-branch target identity matches, runs
  setup, then permits the first prompt. An unpublished incompatible preparation must
  never delay cold fallback; a published incompatible resource must finish cleanup
  before cold worktree materialization so two owners cannot race the same path.
  INVARIANT: speculative-worktree marker mutations are read-check-act on one file and
  are serialized per session (`withSessionMarkerLock` in
  `worktree/speculative-worktree.ts`) — a superseded preparation's dispose racing its
  replacement's materialization must never delete the replacement's directory. A
  prepared worktree may be adopted only when the durable claim did not return
  `mismatch` AND its directory still exists on disk; otherwise discard the prepared
  runtime (its ACP process cwd points at a dead inode) and let the cold path rebuild
  via `createWorktree`. A `mismatch` claim deletes the mismatched directory, so
  adoption after it hands the session a path that is not on disk (the production
  `ENOENT ... stat .../worktrees/<sessionId>` at `turn_pre_prompt_failed`). Full
  lifecycle, sandbox/worktree ownership, crash recovery, TTL, and transport map:
  The detailed contract remains in the private architecture context.
  Launch compatibility must use canonical `buildSessionLaunchConfig` semantics: empty
  env/runtime override values omitted by durable dispatch are equivalent to empty values
  read directly from the agent config during preparation.
- Nested child Sessions are intentionally rejected: workspace ownership currently resolves
  one parent hop only. Do not enable deeper trees without a durable root workspace owner.
- `session-fork-service.ts` owns the fork saga. Its commit boundary is
  `LoroDocumentManager.persistPendingChanges()`, which flushes target meta/history to the owning
  CLI's local SQLite repo before returning success. Cloud `waitUntilSynced()` is never a fork
  success condition: local-machine forks must work offline, while RemoteBridge owns later cloud
  convergence. Persist the target placeholder before invoking ACP; if the final local commit
  fails, terminate the forked ACP session and durably delete the target. An active source turn may
  be forked only when its live ACP connection advertises
  `_meta.lody.forkAtTurn = { version: 1 }`. Persist the adapter-emitted
  `_meta.lody.turnId` on the matching assistant history entry as `acpTurnId`, then return it
  unchanged as `session/fork.params._meta.lody.forkAtTurn.turnId`. Codex emits its native turn id
  and Claude emits its SDK assistant uuid; never infer a boundary from Lody ids or copy the
  unfinished user/assistant suffix. Fork user resolution optimistically reuses the live source
  Session's effective Git identity only when its recorded requester user id exactly matches the
  fork requester; an absent source runtime or mismatch must fall back to `SessionUserResolver`.
  `SessionForkSpec.targetPlacement === 'side-panel'` is a sparse
  presentation hint persisted as target `childSessionPlacement`; it does not alter parent/root
  workspace ownership, history cloning, ACP lifetime, or the fork commit boundary.
  `targetContext.kind === 'new-worktree'` is a distinct asynchronous saga: accept only when the
  provider advertises native fork support, capture the source's committed `HEAD` after any dirty
  source acknowledgement, then persist a target-doc `forkOperation` before returning. Create the
  worktree from that exact commit, run setup, and invoke ACP fork from the new cwd in the background.
  The target is an independent root Session (no `parentSessionId`) and must not publish Session meta
  until the final local commit; failures terminate ACP, remove the worktree/branch, and retain a
  durable failed operation receipt. Retries reuse the caller-supplied target Session id and must not
  duplicate side effects. Startup recovery fail-closes interrupted preparing operations. Because a
  preparing target publishes no Session meta until its final commit, the repo meta index cannot name
  the interrupted operations — recovery discovers them from the machine-local marker store
  (`session-fork-operation-store.ts`), recorded fail-closed at accept (before the target doc exists)
  and cleared only after the final commit/rollback persists. The marker carries the worktree-cleanup
  payload, so recovery never opens the source doc. A marker surviving startup is by construction an
  anomaly (clean success clears it in the same lock as the commit), so recovery always opens the
  named target doc and judges from it with the client's own terminal criteria (failed receipt, or
  cleared flag plus cloned-history origin notice — never the meta record, whose write is not
  flush-atomic with the doc's; the saga commits doc writes first — history BEFORE the flag clear —
  and publishes meta last so a durable `acpSessionId` implies the doc writes landed). A stale
  preparing flag with landed history is cleared and persisted, or the client's fork observer can
  reach neither terminal branch and waits forever. Doc-landed-but-meta-missing (crash inside the
  commit block) is repaired by republishing meta from the marker payload (`title`, `branchName`,
  cleanup fields) with `acpSessionId` absent — the session stays visible and complete except the
  ACP resume identity. Race discipline mirrors the
  speculative-worktree sweep: accept, saga finalize, and recovery all hold `withForkOperationLock`
  per target, recovery re-reads the marker inside the lock, and liveness comes from the service's
  in-memory active-operation set — never from timestamps. Recovery must never enumerate session
  rooms or open docs to find candidates: each open joins the room and pulls its stream, so a full
  scan is O(all historical sessions) of Streams subscriptions at every daemon start, and it must
  never `cleanSessionDoc` a doc it did not exclusively own (see `../lib/loro/AGENTS.md`).
- Antigravity context usage is read from ACP-agent stderr `usageUpdate`
  (internal WS). Its adapter does not emit ACP `usage_update`; do not infer
  Gemini window fill from the CLI release version or from Claude/Codex
  telemetry. Display `size` follows the current picker model
  (`resolveModelContextWindow`); a model or agent switch must not keep the
  previous model's window. Parser: `../agent/acp-usage-update.ts`.
- `session-agent-switch-service.ts` owns same-Lody-session mid-conversation agent changes.
  It is idle-only, same-machine only, and never resumes the previous ACP session: terminate the
  current process, rebind `agentConfigId`/`cliType`/`agentType`, clear `acpSessionId`, then let
  the next turn start with `session/new` and replay Lody history. Provider-native memory is
  lost on purpose; do not invent a portable ACP session id across agents.
- `session-edit-and-resend-service.ts` owns same-Lody-session replacement of the last normal User
  turn for builtin Codex/Claude. Prepare provider `forkAtTurn` (or `session/new` for the first
  User) before cancelling the exact active turn, then wait for old ownership release before one
  durable history-tail/meta commit. Its rewrite barrier is mutually exclusive with message-queue
  promotion and blocks dispatch/steer; the queue itself is never rewritten. Preserve the original
  User attribution/config/attachments unless the edit explicitly changes them, use new logical
  turn ids and ACP session identity, and never replay transcript or roll back filesystem changes.
- `session-launch-config-resolver.ts` / `worktree/worktree-config-resolver.ts` — durable
  launch config rule: do not write per-session `sessionLaunchConfig`; first
  `session/create` payload is transient, resume/dispatch resolve from agent config/project,
  and the legacy row is fallback/cleanup only.
- Resuming a Session on a local project must use the workspace's current branch as-is, including
  worktree mode. A legacy direct local Session can re-enter `session/create` when no ACP session is
  resumable; a non-empty persisted `acpSessionId` proves prior execution, so its stored
  `project.branch` is historical state, not a checkout request. Initial `session/create` writes
  `project` metadata before dispatch but has no ACP session id, and must retain an explicitly
  requested branch. ACP restore or legacy direct-session reinitialization must never switch back to
  the Session's recorded branch.
- `turn-post-processing-service.ts` — post-turn work (titles, notifications).
- `session-access-policy.ts` — local-first dispatch access precheck (optimistic-allow
  cache, D11). It may allow owner-cached turns from the catalog snapshot, deny
  `remote_missing` workspaces, or return `remote` to preserve the existing Convex
  three-state path. Catalog read failures degrade to `remote` (never error).
- `session-access-retry.ts` — remote machine access verification with transient retry.
- `session-user-resolver.ts` + `git-identity.ts` — the requesting user's commit
  identity. The turn's `userName`/`userEmail` become `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*`
  in the session env (`session.ts` `updateGitIdentity`, re-applied per turn via the
  execution service's `bindReadySession`), so a session started by user A commits as
  A. Resolution MUST go through the injected
  `CloudPort.access.resolveWorkspaceUser`; the cloud composition root owns the
  hosted user-resolution operation because the daemon does not own an end-user
  browser session. The local
  access port resolves only its synthetic owner and never performs network I/O.
  `resolveSessionGitIdentity` then falls back to the daemon host's git config — i.e.
  the machine owner. A missing-email placeholder is not a commit identity; prefer the
  cached GitHub `id+login@users.noreply.github.com` address so the commit is
  attributed to the same GitHub account that opens the PR (PR/push identity itself
  comes from the requester-bound GitHub token, not from git config). Every new
  dispatch/delivery path that mints `userName`/`userEmail` must resolve them; a
  placeholder there silently reassigns authorship to the host.

Dispatch access is local-policy first, optional-cloud three-state second. Owner-cached local
policy may allow without network access; `remote_missing` workspaces fail the turn. Otherwise
the remote check is still three-state: definitive `denied` fails the turn;
`indeterminate` means the backend call did not reach a verdict, so the watcher leaves
the turn pending and forks `verifyMachineAccessWithRetry()` with capped backoff.
Do not collapse thrown access checks into denial. Every owner-allowed dispatch also
fires `fireOwnerAccessRecheck` (fire-and-forget, `forceBackendVerification: true`,
bypassing the message-handler owner fast-path): a confirmed online allow is the ONLY
writer of the access snapshot/`verifiedAt`, a definitive deny clears it, and
`indeterminate` writes nothing.
