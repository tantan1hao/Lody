# CLI Agent Guidelines

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.
Root `AGENTS.md` applies; this file adds CLI context.

## Running the CLI in development

`pnpm dev` bundles with esbuild (`scripts/dev-build.mjs`, ~3s) into `dist-dev/`, then
runs `node --enable-source-maps dist-dev/index.js`. `pnpm dev:build` builds only;
there is no on-demand TypeScript-loader fallback, so development startup must
run built JavaScript.
The public CLI defaults to local platform and does not discover deployment dotenv
files. Local and self-hosted modes must never initialize telemetry even if generic
PostHog variables are present in the shell. Self-hosted mode obtains its single-user
identity and Streams origin only from the validated/cached `SelfHostedConfig`.

INVARIANT: the dev output layout must match production's — `index.js` plus flat sibling
`claude-acp.js` / `codex-acp.js` / `*-worker.js`. `agent/setting.ts`, the Tinypool pools
(`file-index-scan-pool.ts`, `diff-line-count-pool.ts`), the direct
`turn-diff-store-worker.ts` client, and `workspace-watch-coordinator.ts` all locate
their child by FILENAME next to
`import.meta.url`. Running directly from `src/` would leave only `.ts` siblings, so pools
would fall back to the main thread (`reason=worker_missing`) and mandatory workers would
be unavailable. `dev-build.mjs` asserts after each build that no
worker-resolving module was hoisted into `chunks/`, because that reintroduces the same
invisible fallback.

Two things the dev build does deliberately, both load-bearing:

- npm packages stay external (that is what makes it fast, and it avoids inlining wasm),
  but they are externalized by ABSOLUTE path — bundling a workspace package's `.ts`
  source moves its imports into this bundle, and pnpm's strict layout has no entry for
  that package's transitive deps under `apps/cli/node_modules`.
- `splitting: true`, so `await import(...)` stays a real lazy boundary. `review-viewer.ts`
  statically imports the generated `lody-code-review-viewer/manifest`, which does not
  exist until that package is built; inlining it would make `lody --version` fail.

## Coding rules

- The CLI's own `version` must be imported from `@/pkg`, never from a relative
  `../package.json`. Each build composition aliases `@/pkg` to the manifest that
  actually gets published (cloud builds point it at the private composing
  package), so a relative import bakes the stale OSS version into the published
  bundle — this is what made `lody@0.82.1 --version` print `0.76.0`. The package
  `name` is the exception: it stays `lody` in every composition.
- context/cli-effect-ts.md — prefer Effect TS idioms
  for new/refactored CLI code: services via `Context.Tag` + `Layer`, typed errors,
  structured concurrency, `Schedule` retries; when raw async/await is OK; interop.
- context/cli-type-safety.md — strict tsconfig
  (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` etc.), no `any`/non-null assertions, Zod for all foreign
  data (JSON.parse, WS payloads, env), dependency type alignment.
- context/cli-prompt-hot-path.md — after the
  CLI receives a remote prompt, only correctness-critical setup may block before ACP
  `agent.prompt`; notifications/analytics/UI summaries must not be awaited there.
- context/cli-startup.md — local-ready boundary,
  remote reconcile sequence, and startup timing trace names.

## Debugging

- Local logs (`~/.lody/logs/`, levels, `lody daemon logs`, ACP stderr capture):
  context/cli-logs.md.
- Preview targets are untrusted. Keep automatic candidates loopback-only and
  require explicit recent user approval before accepting a private literal IP;
  validate path-relative targets at the CLI boundary.
- Embedded CLI packaging invariants (native deps, ABI, child runtime env) live in
  [apps/electron/AGENTS.md](../electron/AGENTS.md). Read them before changing runtime
  deps/bundle externals or spawning `process.execPath` with a filtered environment.
- `engines.node` is pinned to `>=22.14.0` by better-sqlite3's `NAPI_VERSION=10`, and
  `src/utils/sqlite-runtime-support.ts` must stay the FIRST import in `src/index.ts`. Older Node
  segfaults on the SQLite binding instead of throwing. Rationale + the three places that
  must move together: [apps/electron/AGENTS.md](../electron/AGENTS.md) (native deps).

## Process lifecycle

- Read context/local-agent-ownership.md
  before changing local ports/sockets, daemon PID state, Electron/daemon startup,
  Supervisor retries, or Worker shutdown. Health probes are observation only and
  must never authorize PID killing.
- `lody daemon status` reads the runtime probe's explicit `backend` authorization/
  connection state and `connectedWorkspaces`; aggregate `connectivity` is local runtime
  health and must not be presented as proof that the cached CLI token was accepted.

- `lody daemon start` resolves cloud authentication in the FOREGROUND process before
  spawning the detached runner (`commands/daemon-auth-preflight.ts`): validate the cached
  credential against the backend, and on a missing/rejected credential run the interactive
  device-authorization flow (browser link) right there. The runner is detached, so a
  credential failure inside it is invisible. An unreachable backend aborts instead of
  re-authenticating — a network outage must not replace a working credential — and a
  non-TTY run aborts instead of blocking on a browser link until the device code expires.
  `--skip-auth-check` is the explicit opt-out; `--auth` keeps its non-interactive path.
- New one-shot commands should use `src/lib/command-runtime.ts` (`runOneShotCommand`)
  so exit codes, telemetry flush, and stream flushing are handled consistently.
- Process entrypoints, command-owned boundaries, global process-error handlers, and
  generated standalone shims may force exit after their own cleanup policy: `start.ts`
  owns startup/fatal/signal exits; `daemon-runner.ts` owns watchdog fatal and signal
  exits. This is process-boundary policy.
- Never force exit from reusable business libraries, session/agent internals, TUI/watch
  flows, or worker code. Those modules should expose explicit cleanup and let the
  process boundary decide whether to exit.
- Remote daemon restart/upgrade is documented in
  context/machine-lifecycle.md. The RPC handler
  ACKs and asks `start.ts` to exit with the reserved lifecycle code; the watchdog
  performs upgrade/restart work after the worker exits.
- Session read commands (`session list/show/history/status` and `export`) sync Loro
  metadata/docs before reading by default; sync failure is a command failure with an
  `--offline` hint. `--offline` is the explicit local-cache path, not an automatic
  fallback. `lody sync` is the explicit workspace sync command and excludes Code
  Collab file-index Flock docs.
- Persisting a non-empty Task document makes loro-repo register
  `e/task-<id>` in workspace meta; Task business fields are not copied into
  `m/task-<id>/*`. `listAliveRoomIds` enumerates `e/*`. `listWorkspaceTaskIds`
  combines that physical existence source with visible Task Index rows, repairs a
  missing row from its Task document, and honors an explicit index tombstone.
  `sync`, `export`, and account deletion must retain both discovery paths so an
  interrupted or legacy write cannot silently escape coverage.

## `lody app` (open the desktop app on a directory)

- `src/commands/app.ts` registers the directory as a local project through the
  daemon (`local-project/add`, idempotent — the id is a sha256 of the resolved root
  path), then hands the active installation profile's deep link
  (`lody://chat/new?…` for cloud, `lody-oss://chat/new?…` for local) to the OS
  via `utils/open-browser.ts`. Link shape lives in `src/lib/desktop-deep-link.ts`;
  the desktop side parses it in
  `packages/components/src/lib/desktop-open-local-project-deep-link.ts` and routes to
  `/<slug>/chat?context=local&machine=…&project=…`. Both sides pin the URL in unit tests.
- INVARIANT: registration happens only in the CLI. The deep link carries ids, never a
  path, and the app must never register a project from one — any web page can navigate
  the OS to either registered protocol, so a path-carrying link would let a site hand agents an
  arbitrary directory. An unknown project id just stays unselected.
- `workspaceSlug` is present only when the daemon reported workspace candidates (i.e.
  multiple active workspaces). With one workspace the app's current workspace is
  already correct, so the link omits it.
- Daemon down is not a failure: the deterministic project id is computed locally and
  the app still opens (already-registered directories stay selectable); the command
  warns that a brand-new directory was not registered.
- Local-project control transport, workspace-candidate parsing, and the workspace
  picker are shared with `lody project` in `src/lib/local-project-control-client.ts`.

## `lody review` (no-login HTML review)

- `src/commands/review.ts` renders a `.review.md` (or `.review.json[.gz]` snapshot)
  into a self-contained HTML file and opens it; `lody review prompt` prints the agent
  prompt; bare `lody review` prints a 3-step guide. No Lody login is involved.
  Reading `.review.md` resolves against the local Git repo read-only. On render
  failure the action prints `error.message` and sets `process.exitCode = 1`.
- The ~8 MB viewer is NOT bundled. `src/lib/review-viewer.ts` fetches the public
  `lody-code-review-viewer` package's `standalone.html` from jsDelivr (then unpkg)
  at the EXACT version the CLI was built against, verifies its sha256, and caches it
  under `~/.lody/code-review-viewer/<version>.html`. `LODY_REVIEW_VIEWER` (file path
  or URL) overrides the source for offline/mirror use (still sha-verified). The
  pinned version + sha come from the bundled-at-build `lody-code-review-viewer/manifest`
  import (the only viewer piece kept in the CLI bundle; ~3 KB); CLI `build:bundle`
  prepares that viewer package first. The external release pipeline must publish
  the viewer at the same version before the CLI. See `packages/code-review-viewer`.
- The agent prompt IS still embedded (small) via `@lody/code-review-helper/prompt-text`
  (generated by the helper's prompt embed script before bundling), lazy-imported in the action.

## Session create/worktree shortcut

- `lody session create --local-project ... --worktree` is wired by setting
  `ProjectRef.useWorktree` in `src/commands/session.ts`; daemon startup consumes
  that flag in `src/session/session-execution-service.ts`, and actual local/GitHub
  worktree creation happens in `src/session/session-manager.ts`.
- Post-turn automatic commit/push is allowed for GitHub worktrees and local projects
  with `ProjectRef.useWorktree === true`. Never run it against a local project's
  original directory, even when that project has a `githubRepoFullName` or associated PR.
- MCP session tools use stable machine/session/agent-config ids and strict, narrow input
  schemas. New create/chat Commands require a caller-chosen Operation id. Create persists
  the Operation before its fallible availability/materialization step; the normal response
  has durable target input, while a transient post-accept failure returns the active fixed
  target for daemon replay. `session_create({ operationId, resume: true })` recovers that
  Operation without resending the prompt. Completion is delivered automatically, with no
  public wait tool.
  Legacy single create/chat `wait=true` remains a temporary compatibility adapter;
  new callers must not depend on it. Child Sessions are one level deep only.
  An independent Session created from inside another Session persists exact provenance in
  `openedBySessionId`. If that opener is a child Tab, it also sparsely persists the Tab owner's
  root route as `openedByRootSessionId`; clients need both ids to restore the exact originating
  Tab. Do not rewrite the exact opener to the root or treat either pointer as `parentSessionId`.
- Local daemon IPC sends the real control request once; do not restore a health preflight.
  Native `LocalDaemonAvailabilityError` must be thrown outside the Effect runtime boundary
  so MCP can preserve `DAEMON_NOT_RUNNING` versus retryable `DAEMON_BUSY`. A connection
  refusal means not running; timeout/408/429/5xx means busy.
- The task MCP replies are bounded the same way: a task body is capped at 64 KiB with
  head-and-tail truncation (`bodyTruncated` + `bodyOmittedBytes` state it), comments
  return the newest 20 with `commentCount` when more exist, links cap at 50, and
  `lody_task_list` defaults to 20 (maximum 100) reporting `matched` when the page was
  cut. The document itself has no body limit, so an unbounded read would blow the
  caller's context. Keep both ends: `lody_task_edit_body` matches exactly against the
  FULL body server-side, so an agent editing from a truncated view still resolves.
- `lody_task_list` reads the Task Index Flock ONLY (`listTasksFromIndex` →
  `selectTaskIndexRows`). Never make a list path open task documents: that is the whole
  reason the index exists. `order` is deliberately not returned — it is a fractional
  index and callers must not depend on its format.
- `lody_task_update` writes every scalar property EXCEPT `agent`, and never the body.
  Two different reasons, both load-bearing: the body goes through the exact-match edit
  so a content change carries its size delta and origin, while `agent` is the sole
  automation consent — an agent writing it would hand itself a scheduler slot. Do not
  "complete" the surface by adding it.
- INVARIANT: `status`, `ownerId`, and `projects` are all in the delegated-automation
  eligibility predicate (`planTaskAutomation`), so an agent write to any of them can
  START a session on an already-entrusted task. Keep it in mind before adding another
  agent-writable field: anything in that predicate is an execution trigger, not just a
  property. Each write records an attributed activity entry on the task document —
  but note that entry is an audit record, NOT a user-visible notice: `task-thread.tsx`
  deliberately renders only `pr_linked`, because property-edit entries were shown once
  and were unreadable (raw ids) while the properties rail already shows current values.
  So do not cite the timeline as the thing that tells a person their task changed.
- `ownerId` on an agent WRITE accepts ONLY `""` (unassign) — `TaskOwnerIdWriteSchema`.
  Naming an owner points `isTaskAutomationEligible` somewhere new: it runs a task only
  when the owner is the local operator, so an agent that could set that field could
  route a task referencing this operator's agent config into execution under this
  operator's credentials, on a consent belonging to whoever set `agent`. Unassigning
  only ever REDUCES eligibility, so it stays open. This also disposes of the `me`
  sentinel that `lody_task_list` accepts as a filter — stored verbatim it would name no
  user, silently removing the task from every owner view with an `ok` reply.
  **The restriction lives at the MCP boundary, not in `task-doc.ts`**: the document
  layer is also the human write path (the app assigns owners today, a `lody task`
  command would tomorrow) and must stay general. Do not "simplify" by pushing it down.
- `lody_task_create` vs `lody_task_propose` splits on WHO ASKED (user request →
  create now; agent-noticed follow-up → proposal card) and that split lives in the tool
  descriptions on purpose. A forced justification field was considered and rejected:
  it taxes every call to police a boundary whose error cost is one `canceled` task or
  one ignored card. The proposal writer is a one-shot manager: it must hydrate the
  Session doc before its idempotent upsert, flush locally, and confirm remote doc sync
  before returning `ok`; otherwise fast cleanup can strand a card only in local SQLite.
- MCP create takes run config semantically (`modelId`/`reasoningEffort`/`fastMode`/
  `planMode`), never raw ACP option ids. `@lody/shared` `acp-run-config.ts` owns the
  mapping onto each agent's advertised option ids (also the source of truth for the
  web selectors), `applyAgentRunConfigSelection` in `src/commands/session.ts` applies it
  once the target agent's cached capabilities are read, and
  `validateSessionCreateOptions({ dispatchConfig })` rejects unsupported selections
  before the Operation is accepted. `lody_session_create_options` publishes the valid
  values per agent config as `runConfig`. Its default response is sparse: online Machines,
  one default/current agent config, the current local project, and no GitHub repository
  fetch. Agent configs/local projects/repos expand only through their query inputs.
  Durable create acceptance stores each target's resolved effective dispatch config;
  recovery must use it instead of inheriting again from mutable requester history.
- INVARIANT: reasoning effort and fast mode are per MODEL. An ACP probe's
  `configOptions` only describe the model that was current at probe time — agents
  rebuild those options on every model switch and then REJECT a value the new model
  does not support. `acp-capability-normalization.ts` recovers the model-independent
  view into `AcpCapabilityCacheEntry.modelReasoningEfforts` from agents that also
  publish the legacy `model[effort]` list (Codex); effort is validated against the
  TARGET model and the ids so validated come back as `validatedConfigIds`, which
  `validateTurnConfigOptionValues(..., skipIds)` must skip (the probed model's list
  would wrongly reject them). What cannot be checked offline is dispatched as
  requested. Runtime rejections remain in debug diagnostics; Codex/Claude mismatches
  for model, reasoning effort, Fast, or Plan are not promoted to visible
  `agent_warning` notices, while other rejected selections still are. Compatibility exception: Claude
  Fable models omit the Fast mode option, so an explicit `fast=false` is skipped as
  an already-effective no-op; `fast=true` must still be dispatched and retained in debug
  diagnostics if rejected.
- MCP `session_list` defaults to 20 (maximum 100), and `session_history` defaults to 10
  (maximum 50 and 128 KiB). Keep the MCP surface bounded even though the human CLI retains
  `session history --all`. `session_list` and `session_status_many` derive busy/idle from
  the same history, durable queue, presence, and Machine RPC snapshot. Operation/Delivery
  implementation invariants live in
  `src/orchestration/AGENTS.md`; normative behavior lives in
  `specs/session-orchestration.md`.
- Dispatch point-of-no-rollback (`createSessionResult` / `sendSessionChatResult` in
  `src/commands/session.ts`): `writeDispatchPointer` commits `latestUserMsgId` to the
  local repo, after which the daemon may already be executing the turn. Cloud
  confirmation is a separate `confirmDispatchSyncedBestEffort` step that is AWAITED (so
  the push completes before the one-shot `withWorkspaceManager` transport is torn down)
  but NEVER throws — the durable pointer plus the SQLite Operation own delivery, and the
  repo reconciles on its own schedule. The create/chat `catch` must only unwind when the
  pointer was NOT yet written (`if (!dispatched)`); rolling back after dispatch deletes an
  already-running session out from under the daemon and drops its generated title. Do not
  reintroduce a hard-fail Streams ack on the dispatch write.
- A renderer joining a local data-plane Session Doc room must not call
  `LoroDocumentManager.getOrCreateSessionDoc` or retain a live cloud room.
  Renderers may visit thousands of historical sessions; coupling local join to a
  `SessionDocument` retains them until GC and can starve the Host health endpoint. Use the
  bounded raw-doc one-shot reconciliation in `loro/doc.ts`, cancel it on local leave or
  Session activation, and unload renderer-only docs after the last peer leaves. Session
  metadata/RPC activation owns persistent CLI cloud joins. Flock room bridging remains
  explicitly paired to local Flock join/leave.

## Agent feedback

- `lody feedback` and MCP `lody_feedback` submit only caller-provided suggestion text.
  The shared client adds only CLI version, platform, and architecture. Do not add cwd,
  paths, hostname, environment, logs, prompts, conversation history, or file contents.
- Keep obvious-secret rejection in both the CLI and hosted API boundary; instructions alone
  are not the privacy boundary.

## GitHub auth shortcut

- Agent `gh` auth for GitHub repo sessions is managed in
  `src/session/session-manager.ts`: it creates the git credential broker, prepends the
  `~/.lody/bin/gh` shim, and injects/refreshes a managed `GH_TOKEN` when no user token
  is present. The shim lives in `src/lib/gh-shim-script.ts`; token fetching/caching is
  in `src/lib/github-token-manager.ts`; git HTTPS auth uses
  `src/lib/git-credential-helper-script.ts`.
- INVARIANT: host-side git must receive its credential broker as an explicit argument
  (`WorktreeManager.ensureRepo({ brokerAuth })`), never from ambient `process.env`.
  A fleet process runs one `GitCredentialBroker` per workspace, each bound at
  construction to its own workspace-scoped `GitHubTokenManager`, and every one of them
  writes the same process-global `LODY_GIT_CRED_BROKER_*` pair plus the shared
  `~/.lody/broker.json`. The ambient value therefore belongs to whichever workspace
  started or recovered its broker LAST — and `ensureStarted()` early-returns once
  started, so the correct workspace never takes the pointer back. A session in
  workspace A then authenticates through B's token manager and fails with
  `repo_not_linked` → `terminal prompts disabled`, while A's own prefetch succeeds.
  Keep `brokerAuth` a per-call argument: `getWorktreeManager` caches by `repoId` alone,
  so two workspaces sharing a repo share one manager instance. Session process trees are
  already correct (`prepareGitHubRepoSessionConfig` injects the env explicitly); the
  helper's connection-refused fallback is scoped by `LODY_GIT_CRED_BROKER_STATE_FILE`
  (per-workspace `broker-<workspaceId>.json`) for the same reason. Diagnostics must
  probe the same broker the failing command used, or they report a misroute as the
  caller's workspace lacking the repo link.
  Regression test: `src/session/worktree/worktree-manager-broker-auth.test.ts`.

## PR status reconciler

`src/lib/pr-poller/` reconciles PR discovery/association, lifecycle, CI
rollup, and merge/conflict state for this machine's sessions — the
compensation path when the hosted GitHub webhook → Streams fan-out breaks.
Normative spec: `specs/pr-status-reconciler.md`. `PrStatusPoller` is
constructed in `LodyFleet.start()`; per-workspace handles
(`pr-poller-workspace.ts`) are fact sources + write-back destinations only.
All policy lives in pure modules (targets, priority, quota, selection,
provider projection, write-back planning); the scheduler is a thin
orchestrator. Priority comes from `session-viewing` presence and
`lastMessageAt` activity (high lane 20s, low status 5min, no-PR discovery
20min) — there is NO turn-end hook. Batched GraphQL per `(workspace, repo)`
under a per-credential-scope point bucket, provider safety-floor freeze, and
15min→2h repo cooldowns. Write-back plans against freshly read owner meta:
`pullRequests` upserts by URL with the current PR as the LAST item (legacy
fields stripped once), CI/merge live in `SessionMeta.pullRequestState`
(`{s,m,t}`, ≤50B/entry; legacy `r` readiness is no longer written and is
deleted on touch). Scheduling state (never PR status) is in
`~/.lody/pr-poller-state.json`. Env: `LODY_PR_POLL_DISABLED=1` kill switch,
`LODY_PR_POLL_*` overrides (`pr-poller-config.ts`). Module invariants live in
`src/lib/pr-poller/AGENTS.md`.

## ACP adapter provenance

Terminal output history is bounded separately from agent execution output. Read
context/terminal-output-lifecycle.md before
changing ACP terminal notification handling or history compaction.

Builtin Claude/Codex/Grok use bundled adapters plus managed native runtimes; builtin Kimi
launches its managed Node package directly. `src/agent/setting.ts` resolves those four
through `src/agent/managed-agent-runtime.ts`. Builtin DeepSeek Harness is deliberately not
a managed runtime: `src/agent/deepseek-harness-runtime.ts` consumes the pinned profile from
the `packages/acp-extension-dsh` submodule, launches it through Lody's isolated npx cache,
and loads the bundled `deepseek-acp.js` adapter. The extension owns the ACP model,
reasoning-effort, and permission selectors while Harness
continues to own model execution, sandbox enforcement, and one-shot approvals. See
managed runtime context and the
builtin extension checklist.

Built-in provider auto-registration runs from `src/lib/lody.ts`. Provider configs
live in the current machine Flock doc, so registration starts only after the Fleet's
workspace subscription confirms remote identity/access and the remote bridge attaches.
It must then wait for initial meta sync and a confirmed `syncMachineFlockDoc()` before calling
`hasAgentConfig`/`createAgentConfig`; otherwise a stale local doc can create
duplicate built-in configs. If machine Flock sync is not confirmed,
keep a deferred backoff retry instead of dropping the registration attempt.

The adapter packages in `apps/cli/package.json` are public submodule dependencies.
Adapter bugs/behaviors should be fixed in their package sources first:

- `claude` → `packages/acp-extension-claude`, source:
  https://github.com/LodyAI/acp-extension-claude
- `codex` → `packages/acp-extension-codex`, source:
  https://github.com/LodyAI/acp-extension-codex
- shared extension contracts → `packages/acp-extension-core`, source:
  https://github.com/LodyAI/acp-extension-core
- `deepseek` → `packages/acp-extension-dsh`, source:
  https://github.com/LodyAI/acp-extension-dsh

Both adapters ship from these workspace sources; debug behavior there first.

Clean checkouts do not have adapter `dist/` outputs, and existing checkouts may have
stale outputs after a submodule update. Keep `apps/cli`'s `prepare:acp-adapters` step
before both `scripts/dev-build.mjs` in the CLI `dev` script and Vite in the CLI `build`
chain. The `src/claude-acp-entry.ts` / `src/codex-acp-entry.ts` entries import the
adapters' package roots, whose runtime exports point at adapter `dist/`; skipping
preparation can silently launch old capabilities even while the adapter source is current.

When debugging Codex-side ACP behavior (tool_call update shapes, collaboration events,
goal metadata, image generation, history recovery), check the workspace adapter source
first. Managed runtime artifact pins and checksums live in
`src/agent/managed-agent-runtime.ts`; artifact production and publication are
external distribution responsibilities. Observed per-agent edit-evidence behavior and
the ACP protocol reference are documented in `context/acp-protocol.md` and
`context/acp-agent-edit-evidence.md`.
