# Electron contributor guidelines

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.
Root `AGENTS.md` also applies.

## Module boundaries

- `src/main/index.ts` owns Electron lifecycle hooks, event wiring, IPC registration,
  and dependency injection. Keep business logic out of it.
- Put domain services in `src/main/services/*`, IPC handlers and input validation in
  `src/main/ipc/*`, and local-project worker/storage code in
  `src/main/local-project/*`.
- Main-process-only helpers belong in `src/main/utils.ts`. Put cross-runtime types and
  pure logic in `@lody/shared`; shared Electron IPC contracts live in the narrow
  `@lody/shared/electron-ipc` export.
- Electron main and preload code must not import runtime values from the
  `@lody/shared` root barrel. Use a narrow subpath so Node bundles do not pull in
  renderer modules or `loro-crdt` WASM.
- Invoke signatures come from the `IpcService` classes and the one constructor list in
  `register-services.ts`; every public instance method is renderer-facing and must have
  `@IpcMethod()`. Do not restore parallel handwritten invoke contracts or per-method
  preload lists. `packages/components` intentionally imports the inferred service type
  across the app/package boundary with `import type`; the import is erased and must never
  become a runtime dependency. Shared push/send maps remain in
  `@lody/shared/electron-ipc`. Preload exposes only `{ invoke, on, send }`, permits invoke
  channels by the service groups in `preload/ipc-invoke-policy.ts`, and keeps push/send
  allowlists. The IPC registration test keeps that policy aligned with the registered
  service constructors. There is no `window.api`. Validate foreign input at the IPC class
  boundary.
- Preload runs under the renderer CSP. Zod schemas used there must pass
  `{ jitless: true }`; do not add `unsafe-eval` to accommodate Zod's JIT path.

## OSS composition

- `local` is strictly offline. `self-hosted` may connect only to the explicitly embedded
  control/update HTTPS origins and still must not initialize authenticated product-cloud
  behavior or telemetry.
- The build-time `mainPlatformKind` is the source of truth for data directories,
  sockets, run/lock files, host leases, and workspace catalogs. Pass it explicitly;
  never infer it from an inherited `LODY_PLATFORM` value.
- Vite mode `local` injects `VITE_LODY_PLATFORM=local`; mode `oss` injects
  `VITE_LODY_PLATFORM=self-hosted` and requires `LODY_OSS_CONTROL_URL` plus
  `LODY_OSS_UPDATE_URL`. `electron.vite.config.ts` owns both mappings and must clear
  inherited `VITE_*` values before injecting audited constants.
- Run desktop development from the repository root with `pnpm start:local`. It must
  rebuild the embedded CLI and local renderer before launching the bundled CLI; do
  not reuse production/cloud artifacts.
- Cloud desktop development must likewise build and sync the CLI before
  `electron-vite dev`; the direct `apps/cli/dist` lookup is only a missing-staging
  fallback and must not let an older `resources/cli` shadow a fresh build.
- Turning off **Run local agent** is an explicit cloud control-only mode: do not
  probe an embedded or externally started CLI, and keep the local Loro data-plane
  relay disconnected until the setting is enabled again.
- `localPlatform.getSnapshot` atomically supplies the persistent `local:*` user and
  the single `lw_*` workspace from the CLI catalog. Do not split this into independent
  fallbacks. A missing catalog means provisioning; malformed identities or multiple
  active workspaces are errors.
- OSS local and self-hosted modes must not create a PostHog client, write an analytics
  install id, or upload source maps, even when unrelated analytics variables exist in
  the shell.
- Command+Q may wait only for embedded CLI exit. Self-hosted restic backup is detached
  and must not sit on the `before-quit` barrier.

## Renderer and window integration

- Electron 39's Chromium supports native top-level await. Keep renderer and module
  worker builds on native TLA; do not add `vite-plugin-top-level-await` or an
  equivalent full-bundle AST compatibility rewrite. Reprocessing Rollup's complete
  output graph materially increases production renderer peak memory.
- Linux window identity is one contract: the composition's packaged `desktopName`,
  electron-builder's `syncDesktopName`, the pre-ready `app.setDesktopName` value,
  and the AppImage runtime desktop entry must all resolve to the same desktop-file
  basename. KDE uses that identity to associate Wayland/X11 windows with the
  installed icon.
- Generic update metadata may carry localized Markdown under
  `vendor.lodyChangelog.locales.{en,zh_CN}` in addition to the standard English
  `releaseNotes` fallback. Main validates and bounds those remote strings before
  exposing them through `ElectronUpdaterState`; renderer code must use the shared
  safe Markdown renderer rather than raw HTML.
- React render failures are split by owner: the root `createRoot` error callbacks
  persist fatal IPC diagnostics, while `ErrorBoundary` owns caught-error UI and
  PostHog reporting. De-duplicate the same error across React and window events.
  Renderer-mounted notification must come from a committed layout-effect sentinel,
  never a timer or microtask guess.
- Theme changes must also update the native window color in `window-theme.ts`.
  OS appearance changes while `themeSource` is `system` must retint chrome and
  notify the renderer (`app.nativeTheme`). On macOS also subscribe
  to `AppleInterfaceThemeChangedNotification`; Chromium `matchMedia` and
  `nativeTheme.updated` often miss Control Center switches.
- The onboarding window must be native Light before its first renderer paint; normal product windows start from the System theme source.
  Windows title-bar geometry must stay aligned across
  `MAIN_WINDOW_TITLE_BAR_OVERLAY_HEIGHT`, the `h-9` drag strip in
  `routes/__root.tsx`, and the `pt-9` offset in `web-workspace-layout.tsx`.
- `sessionControl.send` streams intermediate responses on `sessionControl.response`
  keyed by request id. The renderer subscribes before `invoke`, removes the
  listener after settlement, and treats only the final response as completion.
- Image preview export (`services/image-export-service.ts`) keeps the native
  menu, clipboard, and save dialog here because the renderer holds the only copy
  of the image (a `blob:` URL main cannot download). Bytes cross once, after the
  menu selection. Naming/filter logic stays in `image-export-core.ts` so it runs
  under `node --test` without the `electron` runtime.
- Use `pnpm --dir apps/electron preview:local` only when a smoke/E2E harness has
  already prepared and validated the OSS build artifacts. That low-level command must
  remain `--skipBuild --mode oss`.

## Embedded CLI and native dependencies

- The embedded CLI launches built JavaScript only; there is no source-loader/Jiti
  fallback. Development and packaged builds must use the same output layout.
- `better-sqlite3`, `@lydell/node-pty`, and `loro-crdt` remain external and must be
  staged under `resources/cli/node_modules` by `scripts/sync-cli-dist.mjs` and
  `scripts/cli-native-deps.mjs`.
- `@lydell/node-pty` and `better-sqlite3 >= 13.0.2` use N-API artifacts. Stage the
  target platform/architecture artifact; do not rebuild by Electron ABI.
- Every embedded-CLI descendant launched through `process.execPath` must inherit
  `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` when it exists. On packaged macOS, omitting it launches a
  second GUI app instead of Node.
- Electron Builder ignores nested staged `node_modules`. `eb-after-pack.mjs` must copy
  them into `app.asar.unpacked`, assert the DeepSeek adapter plus all four pinned
  presets, then probe CLI `--help`, node-pty loading, and a real in-memory SQLite
  database before signing.
- Keep `better-sqlite3 >= 13.0.2`, CLI `engines.node >= 22.14.0`, the first-import
  guard in `sqlite-runtime-support.ts`, and its tests aligned. Older Node versions can
  segfault while loading the N-API 10 binding. Linux armv7 is unsupported.
- When upgrading `@lydell/node-pty`, audit package layout and Windows ConPTY binding
  names. Apply the staged asar-path repair after downloading target artifacts; a pnpm
  patch cannot cover cross-architecture packages fetched during packaging.
- `electronLanguages` must include underscore names used by macOS resources and
  hyphenated names used by Chromium `.pak` files. The after-pack assertion for
  `locales/en-US.pak` is a release gate.

## Release packaging and auto-update

- Always package through `scripts/package-electron.mjs` (`pnpm run package -- <args>`),
  never `electron-builder` directly. It injects the released version via
  `extraMetadata` so `package.json` is a fallback rather than the release source of
  truth, and it forces `--publish never` unless a caller opts in.
- `package-electron.mjs` injects the generic provider only for Windows targets and only
  from HTTPS `LODY_OSS_UPDATE_URL`; this emits NSIS `latest.yml`/blockmap metadata.
  Unsigned macOS self-hosting is DMG-only and reads the bounded `release.json` manifest
  for a manual-download banner. It must not emit ZIP or `latest-mac.yml` until Developer
  ID signing/notarization is deliberately enabled.
- Artifact names must stay space-free. GitHub Releases rewrites spaces in uploaded
  asset names to periods, which would desynchronize them from the names recorded in
  `latest*.yml`. Do not reintroduce `${productName}` into an `artifactName`.
- An unsigned macOS release is manual-install only; never present it as working
  Squirrel.Mac auto-update. Windows self-hosted NSIS may explicitly disable update code
  signature verification while retaining HTTPS and metadata SHA-512 checks.
- The self-hosted release workflow builds only macOS arm64 DMG, Windows x64 NSIS, and
  the Web OSS bundle.

## Verification

- Run the repository checks after source changes. Packaging/native-dependency changes
  also require the Electron packaging probes for every affected target architecture.
- Do not replace deterministic probes with launch sleeps or retry-only tests.
