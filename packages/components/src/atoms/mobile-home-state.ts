/**
 * Persisted filter / view state for the mobile home Chat tab.
 *
 * WHY: The pills above the Chat list were ephemeral `useState` and reset
 * whenever the user navigated away (or hot-reloaded). Carrying them
 * across navigations is the natural user expectation — they're filters,
 * not "tap to apply" actions. `chatScope` already lived in
 * `sidebar-state.ts` (shared with desktop); these five atoms cover the
 * mobile-only pills.
 *
 * Sets aren't JSON-serializable, so each exclusion atom stores a
 * `string[]`. Consumers go through `useMobileHomeExcludedSetAtom`
 * which presents the same `Set`-shaped API the previous `useState`
 * gave us — minimal blast radius at the call sites.
